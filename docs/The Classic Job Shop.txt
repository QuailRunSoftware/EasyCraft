problem statement
-----------------
A simple job shop might have the following features:
1. A number of machine groups.
2. The machines in a group considered identically for all
practical purposes.
3. The number of groups and the number of machines in each are
fixed and remain constant.
4. Orders come in from outside at arbitrary points in time.
5. Each order must go through operations at each of a series of
machine groups.
6. The routing through the shop and the processing time for each
machine group are specified for each order and may be different
for other orders.
7. After an order is processed by one machine group it is
immediately routed to the next.
8. Orders are enqued for each machine on a first-in-first-out
basis.
9. Desired results are the average length of time that orders
remain in the shop and the queue length for each machine group.
10. Results come out at arbitrarily specified points during the
run.
